## Project Objective
- Implement a design from scratch using a given figma page. Once the design is implemented in both HTML and CSS, it'll have to be accessibile and responsive.
My partner Raesean and I created 3 different model for this figma. Raesean worked on the Desktop version while I work on the tablet part of the css then we got together to work on the moblie part.
